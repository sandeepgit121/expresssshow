                <ol>
                    <li>Our goal at Expressshow! is to make your movie-going experience as easy and efficient
                        as possible.</li>
                    <li>Our Purchase Policy is designed to provide you with the information you need to
                        ensure a smooth transaction and trouble-free retrieval of your tickets once you
                        get to the theater.</li>
                </ol>
                <span class="title">Important Note:</span>
                <ol>
                    <li>No Exchanges.</li>
                    <li>In accordance with our Terms of Use, Expressshow! does not offer exchanges of tickets
                        purchased on the Expressshow! Web site or via our mobile site.</li>
                    <li>In addition, tickets purchased through Expressshow! may be subject to a per-ticket
                        Convenience Charge, which is non-refundable except in extraordinary circumstances
                        where a theater was unable to honor your tickets purchased through Expressshow! (i.e.,
                        if a show time is cancelled, no seat was available in the theater, etc.). </li>
                    <li>Before purchasing your tickets we urge you to confirm the title, time and location
                        of the movie you wish to see.</li>
                    <li>At the time of your order, Expressshow! will place an order for your tickets in the
                        theater's ticketing system, reducing the number of seats available for the chosen
                        show time. </li>
                    <li>While this allows us to provide our customers with the clear benefit of guaranteed
                        seats, it prevents Expressshow! and our theater partners from reselling tickets in
                        the event that you do not attend your chosen show time.</li>
                    <li>If you cannot attend a show time for which you have purchased tickets, you may contact
                        the appropriate theater to inquire about their policy on refunds and exchanges.
                    </li>
                    <li>We strongly recommend that you contact the theater's management prior to your show
                        time, as they generally may not issue refunds or provide exchanges after show time.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any refund or exchange is at the discretion of theater management and can only be
                        conducted at the theater box office where the movie is playing. </li>
                    <li>If a refund is available, the theater box office may only refund to you the ticket
                        price, in which event you should contact Expressshow! customer service if you also
                        wish to request a refund of our Convenience Charge in the extraordinary circumstances
                        described above (otherwise, the Convenience Charge is non-refundable, as stated
                        above).</li>
